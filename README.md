# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

Introducing SVGLogoCLI, the dynamic command line tool that lets users create simple logos in a flash! With just a few commands, users can choose their text (up to three letters), pick a shape (triangle, square, or circle), and select its color. When users have answered all questions, a logo.svg file will be created and saved.

## Contributors

There was a great deal of research done to complete this project. part of that research was reading through the documentations for Jest, Node, and Inquirer. I also read through materials and articles fom W3Schools, MDN, StackOverflow, and class resources provided by the bootcamp. I recieved guidance from my classmates and colleague, Andrew Zimmerman, when I was working through the testing process.
